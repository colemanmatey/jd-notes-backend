# Testing Setup

This project includes a basic testing infrastructure using Jest and Supertest.

## Test Structure

- `tests/health.test.js` - Basic API health check tests
- `tests/setup.js` - Jest configuration and test environment setup

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test tests/health.test.js

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Environment

- Tests run in isolated environment with `NODE_ENV=test`
- MongoDB and other external dependencies are mocked
- Database operations are mocked to avoid requiring actual database connection

## Current Test Coverage

âœ… **Health Check Tests**
- API health endpoint (`GET /api/health`)
- 404 error handling for non-existent routes

ðŸ”„ **Future Tests (TODO)**
- Authentication endpoint tests
- Notes CRUD operation tests
- Input validation tests
- Error handling tests
- Integration tests

## Test Configuration

Jest is configured in `package.json` with:
- Node.js test environment
- 30 second timeout for async operations
- Custom setup file for environment variables
- Test file pattern matching `**/tests/**/*.test.js`

## Notes

The current test setup focuses on basic functionality verification. For comprehensive testing of authentication and database operations, consider:

1. Setting up a test database (MongoDB Memory Server)
2. Creating comprehensive mocks for external dependencies
3. Adding integration tests with real database operations
4. Adding performance and load testing capabilities

The health check tests demonstrate that the basic API structure is working correctly and the testing infrastructure is properly configured.
